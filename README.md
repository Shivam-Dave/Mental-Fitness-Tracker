# Mental-Fitness-Tracker
The AI Mental Health Tracker is an innovative project developed as part of the IBM Skillsbuild Foundation by an Artificial Intelligence Intern at the Edunet Foundation.
It is designed to leverage advanced machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models, to predict and assess mental health conditions.
This AI-driven model aims to provide valuable insights and predictions concerning individuals' mental health states.
It is important to emphasize that while the AI Mental Health Tracker can be a valuable tool, it is not intended to replace professional medical advice or diagnosis.
Instead, its primary purpose is to assist doctors and other healthcare professionals in supporting their patients' mental health improvement journeys.
Some of the Key Features of the Mental Fitness Tracker are: Predictive Modeling: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately predict and assess various mental health conditions ,
Comprehensive Insights: Generates in-depth and valuable information to support healthcare professionals in understanding patients' mental well-being and
Data Integration: Integrates user behavior, social media activity, and personal information to provide comprehensive insights for mental health assessment.
